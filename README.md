# Reinforcement-Learning
Q Learning using Python.

Q-Learning is a model-free form of machine learning, in the sense that the AI "agent" does not need to know or have a model of the environment that it will be in.

The first one is based on Gym's Open AI, specifically MountainCar-v0 environment.
Python packages used are gym, numpy and matplotlib.

The second one uses Deep Q-Learning and Deep Q Networks, which I used to buils my own DON agent in python.
Python packages used numpy, pillow, open-cv, matplotlib, pickle, time.
